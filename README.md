Gergana's individual project

- Instructions on starting the project:
    1. The repo folder warehouse-ind-proj is to be opened in VSCode. -> run npm install from the project location in the terminal to install node modules.
    2. To start the frontend: 
        - New terminal gets started in VSCode (or another separate terminal on the computer's OS) -> cd ./frontend -> run the command npm run start from the terminal
    3. To start the backend:
        - Separate new terminal tab gets started in VSCode (or another separate terminal on the computer's OS) -> cd ./frontend -> run the command npm run start:dev from the terminal

Please delete the last symbol of the email and enter the symbol again.

 5. Password is written in the password field.
 Please delete the last symbol of the password and enter the symbol again.
 
 6. Press the Sign In button.

7. You should be redirected to another page, welcomin the user with the corresponding email if they exist.

8. Notes:
 - For the future, there will be error case validation for the redirecting.
  - There is error handling implemented but it works without redirecting the user, which I can show in the presentation.
  Notes, added after the presentation:
  - The frontend, albeit minimal, is responsive due to Bootstrap. The blue background of the sign-in form is a Bootstrap Container.
  - All present CRUD operations in the project have been tested in Postman and work in the backend.
  
 - Snapshot of responsive component:

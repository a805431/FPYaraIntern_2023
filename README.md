 6. Press the Sign In button.

7. You should be redirected to another page, welcomin the user with the corresponding email if they exist.

8. Notes:
 - For the future, there will be error case validation for the redirecting.
  - There is error handling implemented but it works without redirecting the user, which I can show in the presentation.
